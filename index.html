              <p>I am from South Africa , born on January 11 1990.<br>I moved to America about 4/5 years ago.<br>
              I love working out, I love  obstacle races I think its one of the best ways in testing yourself.<br>
             I started to code about a year ago, I picked up my first coding book which was "Coding for dummies" then finished that off and picked up "Coding for beginners". <br>I begun to be able to look at code and see the problems in them.
             I want to be one of the best in the world for web development, my end goal is to be able to have my own company that can create web pages/ programs and is able to host it and secure it.I want to get into Cyberia security, that where I see my company and myself going towards. </p>
